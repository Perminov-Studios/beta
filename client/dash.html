                    Under certain US state data protection laws, you can designate an authorized agent to make a request
                    on your behalf. We may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they

                    Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same

                    fraud-prevention purposes.

                    If you submit the request through an authorized agent, we may need to collect additional information
                    to verify your identity before processing your request and the agent will need to provide a written
                    and signed permission from you to submit such request on your behalf.

                    Financial Incentives
                </h4>
                <p>
                    "Financial incentive" means a program, benefit, or other offering, including payments to consumers
                    as compensation, for the disclosure, deletion, sale, or sharing of personal information.

                    The law permits financial incentives or a price or service difference if it is reasonably related to
                    the value of the consumer’s data. A business must be able to explain how the financial incentive or
                    price or service difference is reasonably related to the value of the consumer’s data. The
                    explanation must include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        a good-faith estimate of the value of the consumer’s data that forms the basis for offering the
                        financial incentive or price or service difference; and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        a description of the method the business used to calculate the value of the consumer’s data.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We may decide to offer a "bona fide loyalty program" under Colorado law, or a "financial incentive"
                    under California law (e.g., price or service difference) in exchange for the retention, sale, or
                    sharing of a consumer’s personal information.

                    If we decide to offer a financial incentive, we will notify you of such financial incentive and
                    explain the price difference, as well as material terms of the financial incentive or price of
                    service difference, including the categories of personal information that are implicated by the
                    financial incentive or price or service difference.

                    Under California law, the value of your personal information to us is related to the value of the
                    free or discounted products or services, or other benefits that you obtain or that are provided as
                    part of the applicable program, less the expense related to offering those products, services, and
                    benefits to program participants.

                    If you choose to participate in the financial incentive you can withdraw from the financial
                    incentive at any time by emailing us at <a
                        href="mailto:support@perminov.studio">support@perminov.studio</a>, or by referring to the
                    contact

                    These Legal Terms and any policies or operating rules posted by us on the Services or in respect to
                    the Services constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you and us. Our failure to
                    exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Legal Terms shall not operate as a waiver of
                    such right or provision. These Legal Terms operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. We may

                    void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Legal
