	 FOOTER PLACEHOLDER (footer.css)
	 Currently unused; retained so future footer overrides can live in
	 their own file rather than bloating `nav.css` or `index.css`.
	 Suggested contents when needed:
		 - Color theming overrides for dark/light
		 - Layout grid adjustments (mobile stacking, spacing)
		 - Animation or intersection observer reveal classes
